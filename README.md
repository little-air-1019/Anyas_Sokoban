# Anyas_Sokoban
"Anya's Sokoban" is a Sokoban game written in C++ with the theme of the animation "Spy Family"
In this game, not only can players enjoy playing through pre-designed levels, but they can also create their own custom levels in the level editor mode. 
In addition, there is a two-player mode available, which allows players to either cooperate and help each other or compete against each other to solve puzzles. 
We hope that this simple game can entertain its players!
